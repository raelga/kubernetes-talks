#Â Pods

## Shell

To create a pod using the configuration in `shell.yaml`, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f shell.yaml
```

After running the command, you should see an output similar to this, indicating that the pod was created successfully:

```
pod/shell created
```

To verify that the pod is running, you can list all the pods using the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

The output will look something like this, showing the status of all the pods currently running in your Kubernetes cluster:

```
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
shell        1/1     Running   0          6s
```

The above output shows the status of all running pods. The shell pod is running and has not restarted since it was created 6 seconds ago.

To get more detailed information about the pods, including the node they are running on and their IP addresses, you can use the -o wide option:

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

This command will display additional details about each pod, such as the IP address and the node where the pod is running.

```sh
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE                 NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
shell        1/1     Running   0          14s     10.244.0.5   kind-control-plane   <none>           <none>
```

To get the YAML representation of the pod, you can use the `-o yaml` option:

```sh
kubectl get -o yaml pod shell
```

This command will display the YAML representation of the pod, including its IP address and start time.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
...
  podIPs:
  - ip: 10.244.0.40
  qosClass: BestEffort
  startTime: "2024-07-01T15:49:20Z"
```

To view and edit the pod configuration with your default text editor, you can use the `kubectl edit` command:

```sh
kubectl edit pod shell
```

To get human friendly detailed information about the pod, you can use the `kubectl describe` command:

```sh
kubectl describe pod shell
```

This command will display detailed information about the pod, including its status, IP address, and container details.

```

To interact with the running pod, you can use the `kubectl exec` command followed by `-ti` (which stands for "terminal interactive"), the name of the pod, and the shell command:

```sh
kubectl exec -ti shell -- /bin/sh
```

To display the currently running processes in the pod, you can use the ps aux command:

```sh
ps aux
```

The output will look something like this, showing the currently running processes:

```
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 root      0:00 sleep 3600
   13 root      0:00 /bin/sh
   18 root      0:00 ps aux
```

To delete the pod, you can use the `kubectl delete` command followed by `-f and the name of the configuration file:

```sh
kubectl delete -f shell.yaml
```

The output will confirm that the pod was deleted:

```
pod "shell" deleted
```

## Hello Sh

The output will confirm that the pod was created:

```sh
kubectl apply -f hello-sh.yaml
```

The output will confirm that the pod was created:

```
pod/hello-sh created
```

To view the logs of the `hello-sh`` pod, use the following command:

```sh
kubectl logs -f hello-sh
```

The output will display the message printed by the `hello-sh`` pod:

```
Hello Kubernetes from hello-sh!
```

To see the differences between the `hello-sh.yaml` and `hello-sh-updated.yaml` files, use the `diff` command:

```sh
diff hello-sh.yaml hello-sh-updated.yaml
```

The output will show the lines that differ between the two files:

```
8d7
<     tier: demo
13c12
<     command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Hello Kubernetes from $(hostname)! && sleep 30']
---
>     command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Hello Kubernetes from $(hostname)! && sleep 3600']

```

To update the `hello-sh` pod with the configuration in `hello-sh-updated.yaml`, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f hello-sh-updated.yaml
```

However, you may encounter an error message like the one below. This is because some fields in the pod spec cannot be updated once the pod is created.

```
The Pod "hello-sh" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: pod updates may not change fields other than `spec.containers[*].image`,`spec.initContainers[*].image`,`spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`,`spec.tolerations` (only additions to existing tolerations),`spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (allow it to be set to 1 if it was previously negative)

                },
        },
        EphemeralContainers: nil,
        RestartPolicy:       "Always",
        ... // 28 identical fields
  }
```

To delete the `hello-sh` pod, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl delete pod hello-sh
```

The output will confirm that the pod was deleted:

```
pod "hello-sh" deleted
```

## Hello Web

To create a new pod using the configuration in `hello-web.yml`, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f hello-web.yml
```

The output will confirm that the pod was created:

```
pod/hello-web created
```

To view the logs of the `hello-web` pod, use the following command:

```sh
kubectl logs -f hello-web
```

The output will display the startup logs of the `hello-web` pod:

```

```

```sh
kubectl delete hello-web
```

However, this will result in an error because `hello-web` is not a recognized resource type:

```
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "hello-web", it's a pod.
```

The correct command to delete the `hello-web` pod is as follows:

```sh
kubectl delete pod hello-web
```

The output will confirm that the pod was deleted:

```
pod "hello-web" deleted
```

## Busybox

To create a new pod using the configuration in `busybox-0.yaml`, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f busybox-0.yaml
```

To create multiple pods using the configuration in `busybox-30.yaml`, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f busybox-30.yaml
```

```
pod/busybox-1 created
pod/busybox-2 created
pod/busybox-3 created
pod/busybox-4 created
...
pod/busybox-29 created
pod/busybox-30 created
```

To view the status of all pods, you can use the `kubectl get pods` command:

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

The output will display the status of all running pods:

```
â¯ k get pods
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
boom         1/1     Running   0          17m

busybox-12   1/1     Running   0          51s
...
```

To delete all pods with the label `app=busybox`, you can use the `kubectl delete pod -l` command:

```sh
kubectl delete pod -l app=busybox
```

The output will confirm that the pods were deleted:

```
pod "busybox-0" deleted
...
pod "busybox-30" deleted
```

##Â Pod Selector

### Equality

To create a new pod with the configuration in `pod-selector-equality.yml`, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f pod-selector-equality.yml
```

The output will confirm that the pod was created:

```

To view detailed information about the `cuda-test` pod, use the following command:

```sh
kubectl describe pod cuda-test
```

```
